Dr. Aaron Brooks received a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry (2007) and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science (2007) from the University of New Mexico. He completed his PhD in Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Washington (2014) as a DOE Office of Science funded research fellow at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington. He is currently a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie funded interdisciplinary EIPOD fellow in Professor Lars Steinmetz's group at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany. Aaron's research focuses on identifying molecular mechanisms that mediate complex phenotypes from large, heterogenous genome-wide datasets.
